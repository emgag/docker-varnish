**WARNING:** Dockerhub images are no longer maintained. Please use ghcr.io! 

[Varnish](http://varnish-cache.org/) container image used within EMGAG environments. Originally based on [newsdev/docker-varnish](https://github.com/newsdev) (not available anymore), but updated to recent varnish versions (6.0, 7.1 and 7.2), shipped with some additional [vmods](http://varnish-cache.org/vmods/#vmods), better support for custom configuration and built for multiple architectures.

Shipped VMODs:
* [libvmod-digest](https://github.com/varnish/libvmod-digest): HMAC, hash and base64 functions
* [libvmod-dynamic](https://github.com/nigoroll/libvmod-dynamic): Dynamic backend director
* [libvmod-querystring](https://github.com/Dridi/libvmod-querystring): Advanced query-string filtering.
* [varnish-modules](https://github.com/varnish/varnish-modules): Official varnish vmod collection (tcp, vsthrottle, xkey, saintmode, bodyaccess, header, var)

## Registries

* Github Container Registry: [ghcr.io/emgag/varnish](https://github.com/orgs/emgag/packages/container/varnish) (Images starting from 6.4.0, 6.3.2 and 6.0.6)
* Dockerhub: [emgag/varnish](https://hub.docker.com/r/emgag/varnish) (Archive only, no longer updated!)

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

* [`7.3.0` (*7.3.0/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/emgag/docker-varnish/blob/master/7.3/Dockerfile), based on debian:bullseye-slim.
  * linux/amd64
  * linux/arm64 (see notes)
* [`7.2.1` (*7.2.1/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/emgag/docker-varnish/blob/master/7.2/Dockerfile), based on debian:bullseye-slim.
  * linux/amd64
  * linux/arm64 (see notes)
* [`6.0.11` (*6.0.11/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/emgag/docker-varnish/blob/master/6.0/Dockerfile), based on debian:stretch-slim.
  * linux/amd64
  * linux/arm64 (see notes)

**Notes:** 
* While the container images are built for Linux amd64 and arm64, **only amd64 is tested and used in production**, the others may or may not work.  
* This repository does **not contain shorthand tags** (e.g. latest, 6, 6.1, etc.), just fully qualified versions corresponding to shipped varnish version and occasionally an additional package version (e.g. 6.0.3-1) if something in the image changed within a varnish release. This is because it might happen that a specific vmod stopped being supported for whatever reason and removing it will break future releases, which is outside of our control (e.g. old releases contained libvmod-geoip, which isn't supported anymore).
* **Only 7.3, 7.2 and 6.0** are [versions supported by varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/releases/index.html), maintained in this repo and available for download from github container registry and dockerhub.
* The most recent of the **unsupported** legacy versions, 4.1.11, 5.0.0. 5.1.3 and 5.2.1 are available from dockerhub as well. 
* For docs and code for versions 4.x and 5.x see [branch 4.1](https://github.com/emgag/docker-varnish/tree/4.1).  

## Varnish

From [varnish-cache.org](https://varnish-cache.org/intro/index.html): _Varnish Cache is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture._

## How to use this image.

By default, varnish reads `/etc/varnish/default.vcl` on startup. Either copy your VCL file in your Dockerfile  
  
```
FROM ghcr.io/emgag/varnish:7.3.0
COPY default.vcl /etc/varnish/default.vcl
```

or mount a volume containing the varnish configuration to `/etc/varnish`, e.g with a docker-compose file:

```
version: '3'
services:
  varnish:
    image: ghcr.io/emgag/varnish:7.3.0
    volumes:
      - ./varnish:/etc/varnish
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

Following environment variables can be used to customize the behaviour of the container:
* VARNISH_CONFIG (default: `/etc/varnish/default.vcl`): The VCL file read on startup.
* VARNISH_DAEMON_OPTS: Additional command line arguments for `varnishd`.
* VARNISH_LISTEN (default: `:80`): The TCP port to listen for incoming client connections. Make sure to also expose the new port if this value is modified.
* VARNISH_MANAGEMENT_LISTEN (default: `127.0.0.1:6082`): The TCP port to listen for management connections. See varnish documentation about [management interface authentication](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/run_security.html) to setup a PSK.  
* VARNISH_STORAGE (default: `malloc,100m`): The cache backend and its configuration
